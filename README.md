Code and data necessary to reproduce figures presented in our paper 
"Two-Streams Revisited: General Equations, Exact Coefficients, and Optimized Closures" (Ho, and Pincus 2023).
The figures and code to reproduce them are in the Jupyter Notebook `Two-stream_revisited_code.ipynb`.
We also provided code to further explore the dataset of optimized coupling coefficients `optimized_coupling_coefficients.npz`.
